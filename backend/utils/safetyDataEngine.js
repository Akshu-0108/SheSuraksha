/**
 * SAFETY DATA ENGINE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * getAreaSafetyStats() is now DATA-DRIVEN for `safetyScore`: it queries
 * real Delhi-NCR crime incidents (loaded from delhi_crime_data.csv into
 * the CrimeRecord collection at server startup — see seedCrimeData.js)
 * within a radius of the locality's coordinates, and derives the score
 * from how many incidents are nearby and how severe they are.
 *
 * illuminationPercent, crowdDensityLevel, safeHavenCount, and
 * policeResponseTimeMinutes are STILL simulated (deterministic, seeded
 * by the locality name) — we don't have real data sources for those yet.
 * Swap them out the same way later (see comments below).
 *
 * getRouteOptions() is unchanged — still fully simulated.
 *
 * The RESPONSE SHAPE returned by getAreaSafetyStats() is identical to
 * before: { locality, illuminationPercent, crowdDensityLevel,
 * safeHavenCount, policeResponseTimeMinutes, safetyScore, lastUpdated }.
